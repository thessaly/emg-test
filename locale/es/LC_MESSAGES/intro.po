msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An important part of undergraduate education in physiology is "
"understanding the musculoskeletal system. This e-book and course is "
"designed to teach students about muscle structure and function in an "
"interactive way that combines theory and practice. Classes with "
"information about muscle anatomy, mechanisms of contraction, and "
"generation of electrical activity in muscle cells are accompanied by "
"experimental practicals that introduce students to the technique of "
"electromyogram (EMG) recording. Through these activities, students learn "
"how to record the electrical activity of their muscles using EMG, and how"
" EMG can be used to investigate aspects of muscle activation, "
"biomechanics, force generation, motor unit recruitment, and muscle "
"fatigue. In addition, computational practicals teach students how to "
"analyze EMG recordings to quantify different elements of muscle activity,"
" introducing and reinforcing important data science skills."

msgid ""
"The chapters in this e-book each cover a different experimental or "
"computational practical, complete with complementary theoretical lesson "
"plans (including supplementary slide decks), experimental protocols, "
"analysis code written in Python, and sample data sets for exploration. "
"All materials are publicly available and openly licensed for reuse, both "
"herein and at the following links:"

msgid "How to use this e-book"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This e-book and its contents are designed to be modular in nature such "
"that they can be reused and remixed in a variety of ways. The full suite "
"of materials can be used sequentially to run a complete stand-alone "
"course in muscle physiology and EMG. However, educators could instead use"
" only some of the materials to supplement other course activities, "
"depending on their needs. For example, an educator teaching a physiology "
"course could run just the ‘EMG Basics’ practical (Ch. 1) to reinforce "
"concepts seen in their class regarding electrical activity in muscle. Or,"
" an educator teaching a data science course could use our sample EMG "
"recordings and the ‘EMG Analysis’ practical (Ch. 3) to have their "
"students apply analysis techniques to physiologically relevant data sets."
" Open licensing of all the materials also means that the materials can be"
" modified as educators see fit. The lesson plans were originally designed"
" with a Biomedical Physics curriculum in mind, but can be adapted to have"
" more of a biological or physiological focus, depending on the intended "
"audience."
